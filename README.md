A simple python script to help make decisions. You can rank the options for a decision or assign a particular mood to a options to enhance the choices made. 
A random choice can also be made from the options. Finally, a decision can be made based on the user's most popular options from past uses. If the user is not 
pleased with the option presented, they can regenerate the solution offered by the program. I will add more to this file as I continue and finalize the functionality.
This includes hopefully developing a different, more accessible interface in the future.
